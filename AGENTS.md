```

## Architecture

### Public API

`src/index.ts` owns the package export surface. Public functions, classes, and types are re-exported from this file. Internal modules are not imported directly by consumers.

### Feature Modules

Feature modules expose small, typed APIs. Each module owns its validation rules and throws library-specific errors for invalid input.

### Errors

`errors.ts` exports `LibraryError` as the shared library error base. Feature-specific errors extend `LibraryError`.

## Distribution

The package is developed with Bun and consumed on Node.js and Bun. `tsc` emits ESM JavaScript and `.d.ts` declarations to `dist/` from `tsconfig.build.json`.

The `exports` map resolves per runtime:

- `default` → `dist/index.js` with `dist/index.d.ts` types (Node.js, CommonJS, and bundlers).
- `bun` → `src/index.ts` (Bun consumes the TypeScript source directly).

The built `dist/` is committed so a git-reference consumer installs prebuilt output with no build toolchain, avoiding an install-time build under the consumer's package manager. `run-package-checks` rebuilds `dist/` and fails when the committed output has drifted. `files` publishes `dist/` and `src/` if the package is ever packed for a registry.

## Development Commands

```sh
bun run fix          # Biome autofix
bun run check        # Biome lint + tsc --noEmit
bun test             # Bun unit and integration tests
bun run build        # Emit dist/ with tsc
bun run publint      # Lint the published package surface
bun run attw         # Validate exports and type resolution across Node.js and bundlers
```

## Development Guidelines

- `bun run fix` runs before `bun run check`.
- Relative imports within `src/` use explicit `.js` extensions so `tsc` emits Node-resolvable ESM. Bun and bundler type resolution map the `.js` specifier to the `.ts` source.
- Tests assert public behavior through exports from `src/index.ts`.
- Unit tests live next to source files under `src/` and test pure transformations.
- Integration tests live under `tests/` and test filesystem, CLI, subprocess, or network behavior.
- Behavior is tested once with `bun test`; it is not mirrored per runtime. Node.js consumability is guaranteed by the `tsc` build plus `attw`, which statically models Node.js module and type resolution against `dist/`.
- Feature modules remain runtime-independent and avoid process, filesystem, and network side effects unless that is the module's explicit responsibility.
- New public APIs include tests at the package boundary.
- Package consumers import from the package root, not from nested source files.

## Documentation Rules

Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state of the system. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are not used.
